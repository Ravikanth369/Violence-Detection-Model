# Violence-Detection-Model

This project is a Flask-based web application for image classification to detect and classify images as either "violence" or "non-violence". It leverages a trained TensorFlow model to process input images uploaded via the web interface, predict their category, and display the results with confidence levels. The application also includes pre-processing of input images and the restoration of a pre-trained model for classification.
